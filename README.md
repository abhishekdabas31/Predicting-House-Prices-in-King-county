The notebook will provide:- 

1. Loading the "King House County Data" taken from Kaggle
2. Exploring the Data:-
We are using many data visualization techniques like bar graphs, pair plots, dist plots, heat maps and box plot to understand and visualize the data to see the patterns.

> Performing basic functions like
data.describe() 
data.columns
data.head()
data.isnull().any()
data.describe()
data.shape


> Data Cleaning and Visualisation : This section will revolve around exploring the data and visualising some summary statistics.

>>>Visualization:
>>seaborn: - statistical data visualization. Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
>>Scatterplot
>>>>We generally use scatter plots to find the correlation between two variables. 
>>Detecting Outliers
>>>>An outlier is a point or set of points that are different from other points. Sometimes they can be very high or very low. It's often a good idea to detect and remove the outliers. Because outliers are one of the primary reasons for resulting in a less accurate model. Hence it's a good idea to remove them. 

3. Exploratory Data Anlysis (EDA) 
It is basically understanding the dataset by summarizing the main characteristics often plotting them visually. Which could consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more.
Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important. 
Data profiling is concerned with summarizing your dataset through descriptive statistics.
The goal of data profiling is to have a solid understanding of your data so you can afterwards start querying and visualizing your data in various ways.
